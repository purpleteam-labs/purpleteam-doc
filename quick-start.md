# quick start

The quickest way to get up and running with having your Web application under test is to:

1. Obtain a purpleteam-labs `cloud` account (We manage everything in the cloud for you)
2. Get the [purpleteam CLI](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam) on your system and [configure it](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam#configure)
3. Create a Build User config (Job). There are some examples [here](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam/tree/main/testResources/jobs)
4. [Start testing](https://github.com/purpleteam-labs/purpleteam#run)

Purpleteam CLI can be run manually, driven from your CI, or other builds, to continuously inform you of security regressions in the Web applications that you are developing. This way you can easily find and fix your defects as they are being introduced.
