| _Emissary/Emissaries_ | Containerised tools that do the _Testers_ bidding, ZapAPI, Nikto, sslyze, etc. The intention is that you will be able to add your own
| _Job_               | Test job defined by the config `POST`ed to the _orchestrator_ `/test` or `/testplan` route. Also referred to as `buildUserConfig`

| _Outcomes_          | Resources (generally in the form of files) that are generated by _Testers_ and transferred from the _orchestrator_ (or API in the `cloud` environment) to a file path location specified in the CLI configuration
| _Purple&nbsp;Team_  | Organisation with _Build Users_ that consume _purpleteam_ 
| _purpleteam_        | The CLI component of the purpleteam solution, often just referred to as the CLI in the context of the purpleteam solution
